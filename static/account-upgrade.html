<h2>Users moving from the old Hackage</h2>
<p>This new Hackage implementation uses a somewhat more secure system
for logging in. Because of this change, users who had accounts on the
old system need to do a one-time upgrade step.
</p>

<form class="box" action="/users/htpasswd-upgrade" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
<p>You will be prompted to enter your existing username and password.
Your account will be re-enabled and you will then be able to use the
new site normally.
</p>
<input type="submit" value="Upgrade account">
</form>

<p><small>Note that if the upgrade is successful then the old auth
information will be deleted and trying to upgrade again will fail.
</small></p>


<h3>Technical details for the curious</h3>

<p>The old hackage implementation used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication">HTTP basic authentication</a>. The new system uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication">HTTP digest authentication</a>.

<p>We could not transparently upgrade accounts to the new system because
the password hash format is different for the new system. The old
format was the
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/misc/password_encryptions.html#basic">
Apache basic auth 'CRYPT' format</a>, while the new format is
equivalent to the
<a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/misc/password_encryptions.html#digest">
Apache digest authentication format</a>. It is not possible to generate
the new format without access to the plaintext password &ndash; which
was never stored. So by authenticating once using the old account
information &ndash; using HTTP basic authentication &ndash; we can
generate and store password digest for the new system.
